# Shortest-Path-Calculator
A tool that tests the performance of Dijkstra's algorithm using two different priority queue data structures, the binary heap and the Fibonacci heap. Can be run through NetBeans or as a separate Java application. 

**Note on ownership:** The Fibonacci heap and associated classes were originally implemented by [Keith Schwarz] (http://www.keithschwarz.com/). This project makes use of these implementations, with some modifications as appropriate.
